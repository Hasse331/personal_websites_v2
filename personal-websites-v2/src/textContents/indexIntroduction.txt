        My Projects Portfolio showcases a breadth of applications, from
        single-page applications in React to complex APIs with Python. These
        projects not only demonstrate my technical skills but also my ability to
        see through a project from idea to implementation. My Internships and
        Work Experience have provided me with invaluable insights into the
        software development lifecycle, team collaboration, and project
        management in real-world settings. Additionally, my contributions to
        Open Source reflect my commitment to the developer community and my
        belief in the power of collaborative innovation.
