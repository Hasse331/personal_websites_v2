      <h5>Passion for Tech and Computers</h5>
      <p className="mb-4 text-justify " style={{ whiteSpace: "pre-line" }}>
        I have been fascinated and passionate about the internet, tech,
        computers, and IT my whole life. From my childhood playing the Moomins
        game, then watching my brother playing Morrowind. I was about 14 years
        old when I bought my first PC with the salary I earned at my first
        summer job at my uncle&apos;s farm. Then I became the PC expert at my
        school, building computers for my friends, and helping them with any
        technical problems. I wrote my first code about this time by writing
        batch scripts for Minecraft servers, and also some harmless viruses on
        school computers.

      <h5>Path to Software Developer</h5>
      <p className="text-justify">
        Later, I went to study another profession outside of this interest of
        mine to find out that it was not for me. However, my previous passion
        started to call me back to my roots. I started to move back to my true
        interests first in digital marketing and entrepreneurship, and finally,
        fully committed in full-stack software development. During the end of my
        military service, I started as a freelancer, first in music production
        but translated quickly to digital marketing, and CMS website building.
        Soon, I also founded my first company and e-commerce business,
        kelloranneke.fi what is still running today, operated by my close
        relative, to whom we sold the business. Today, I have a solid
        understanding of business, marketing, and great communication skills,
        combined with my vast real-world full-stack software development
        projects, education, and courses. As I continue on this path, I remain
        open to learning and growing in the field of technology. It&apos;s been
        a journey of adapting, building, and helping where I can, always looking
        forward to the next challenge and opportunity to improve.
